# Litterfall_XGS_project
In this project, we aimed to study whether more tree species will increase tree litter production, as well as behind mechanisms like temporal complementarity effect. Experiment was carried out in BEF-China (http://www.bef-china.de/index.php/en/publications) platform in both sites. We chose VIP and VIP-rep plots in both site A and site B with a gradient of tree species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). In each plot, we installed three traps in the central area and collect litterfall monthly in the senescing season from 2014 to 2016 in site A and from 2015 to 2016 in site B. In year 2016, we measured litterfall in every month, including non-senescing season.
